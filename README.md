# Pan-Card-Tampering-Detection
The purpose of the project is to detect tampering of PAN Card using computer vision. This project can enable small organisations to detect whether the PAN card provided by customers is original or not!  Conventionally the organisations verify the PAN number only That if it exists online or not.   Work Flow:  1. Get Image from the user 2. Check for size and format of the image 3. Change shape and size of Image according to the original image 4. Convert the image to greyscale 5. Find the similarity index of the images. 6. Finding the Threshold of the image. 7. Finding the `Contour` and Grab them using `IMUTILS` 8. *Draw a Bounding Rectangle using these contours* 9. Plot Difference, Threshold, Original and Tampered Image 10. Compare all the images and check the Similarity score to Decide *Tampering*
